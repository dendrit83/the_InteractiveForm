## the_Interactive_Form project.
This is project 3 of my fullStackJavaScript techDegree, all about user experience and interaction with the **form**.

## Motivation
Although mandatory, this project was incredible motivational for me, because i could start to experience real world web app coding. It was a really challenging project.

## Build status
Web app Up and Running good. ;)

## Code style
vanilla JavaScript.

## Tech/framework used
No frameworks nor plugins

## Features
* real-time error messages: <code>input</code> event listeners implemented along with validation helper functions. This was done for better user experience in error checking status. Checking errors only with the submit event is more error prone, and as the statistical studies suggest more people ends abandoning the form, instead of completing it.

* conditional error messages: the email field has to possible error messages, one if no email was entered, and another if the format is not correct.

## Installation
Just download the files and open index.html on any tested browser.

## Tests
At the time of this README.MD April 2021. no console errors or bugs are reported.


## Contribute
Please feel free to clone it, test it and colaborate with anything you might think will improve the app.
